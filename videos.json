When he arranges to have the fire king's shapely daughter, Teegra (Cynthia Lenke), kidnapped, the adventure begins as she escapes her captors and hooks up with Lorn (Randy Norton), lone survivor of an earlier skirmish. With the aid of a mysterious dark warrior (based on Frazetta's famous painting \"The Death Dealer\"), Lorn and Teegra fight the armies of Nekron as well as giant monsters, lesbian sorcerers, and other comic book delights. A thunderous classical score by William Kraft adds excitement to this violent, sexy, fast-moving film. It also benefits from unusual animation techniques that nicely complement the far-out imaginations of Frazetta, Bakshi, and screenwriters Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway.",
